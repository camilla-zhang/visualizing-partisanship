# [US Partisanship Visualization](https://newsapp-for-newsroom.shinyapps.io/partisanship-in-america/)

This project was completed by Camilla Zhang, Katrina Deng, Liam Tay Kearney, Yun Choi, and Shawn Abraham for Thomas Brambor's Data Visualization course in Spring 2022. Our project, was presented as a Shiny dashboard and includes 4 main visualizations that compare speech patterns between congressmen/women at different levels:

1. By Legislature
2. By Topic
3. By Gender
4. By Individual

The data used for this project comes from the floor speeches from the 112th to 117th Congresses. We then took a topic modeling approach to create the visualizations so that our visualizations could compare which topics were most/least talked about. My individual task for the project was to create the topic model by finding the optimal number of topics using two different tuning parameters. I then created a seeded LDA model to pre-define our topics.
